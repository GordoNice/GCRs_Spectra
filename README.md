The program with GUI for calculating spectra of GCR particles with spectrum modulation
depending on the value of the Wolf number, the calculations are based on the model described in
[article written by Daniel Matthiä, Thomas Berger, Alankrita I. Mrigakshi and Günther Reitz](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117712005947)

Side info: this program was written by me for my master's thesis and PhD as a useful tool for MC calculations, providing initial data of the GCR spectra with Z from 1 to 28 ([see also the work where this program was used](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12036-020-9620-3)).
